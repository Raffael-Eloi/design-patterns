# Structural Patterns

Structural patterns are design patterns that deal with object composition and typically identify simple ways to realize relationships between different objects. 
- They help ensure that if one part of a system changes, the entire system doesn't need to do the same. 
- They also help simplify the design by identifying a simple way to realize relationships between entities.
- Concerned with the structure of classes and objects
- Many patterns are wrappers that mimic the underlying class' interface
- Stress the importance of good API design
